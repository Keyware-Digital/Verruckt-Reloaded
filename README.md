About the mod:
--------------

If you are the kind of guy that hates the type of mod which changes Nazi Zombie Gameplay completely, and you just want a mod to improve, fix and expand upon what Treyarch have already given us - this mod is for you! Verruckt Reloaded does exactly that! For a full detailed list of what my mod does, scroll down for more information.
